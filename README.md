# RecLogger
A keylogging system designed to capture all keystrokes on a target system and transmit them in real time to a central server over an encrypted connection. It uses C++ for efficient keystroke capture and Node.js to send live updates via SSH, ensuring fast, secure, and reliable transmission of data while maintaining encryption and integrity.
